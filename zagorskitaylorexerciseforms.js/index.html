       <h3>the harp-electric</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>Omnichord</strong> is an electronic musical instrument introduced in 1981
          by the Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation. It allows users to play
          distinctive harp-like arpeggios produced through an electronic strum
          plate, simulating the experience of playing a stringed instrument.
          Originally conceived as an electronic Autoharp, the Omnichord found
          popularity due to its portability, its unique timbre, and its value as
          a kitsch object.

      <section id="history">
        <h2>history</h2>
        <p>
          The development of the Omnichord started with a request from an
          overseas sales company to make an electronic musical instrument like
          an auto-harp.[citation needed] Suzuki started with the Tronichord
          'PC-27', renamed the Portachord on some units, followed by the first
          Omnichord 'OM-27', which featured improvements to the interface, such
          as the chord buttons. The OM-27 and PC-27 and were both released in
          1981, but the latter never reached full production.

        <h2>sound and features</h2>
        <p>
          Omnichords feature preset rhythm patterns with tempo and volume
          control, as well as an auto-bass line feature, which the player can
          combine to use as a musical accompaniment. The Omnichord's most unique
          feature is the Sonic Strings strum plate, that allows the player to
          'strum' arpeggios like a guitar.[13] Several later models of the
          Omnichord added MIDI compatibility, a greater selection of sounds for
          the Sonic Strings, vibrato, and chord memory, called Chord Computer.

        <h3>main sound generators</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A percussion section that plays rock, waltz, slow rock, Latin,
            foxtrot and swing rhythms, with adjustable tempo and volume.
          </li>
          <li>
            A chord generator providing different triad and seventh chords,
            either as organ-like chords or walking bass. The original OM-27 was
            only capable of playing 27 different chords, but later models allow
            84 different chords.
          </li>
          <li>
            A Sonic Strings section producing an arpeggio or isolated notes from
            a chosen chord over a 4-octave span, played using the touch strip.
            The notes played on the touch strip are always in tune with the
            chord button currently selected.[16] Later models featured a
            selection of different voices for the Sonic Strings, including
            vibes, brass, organ, guitar and banjo.

        <h2>notable uses</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Eurythmics used chords and Sonic Strings from an Omnichord OM-27 on
            "Love Is a Stranger" from their 1983 album Sweet Dreams (Are Made of
            This).
          </li>

            Canadian producer Daniel Lanois has used Omnichords throughout his
            career; he used one on "Deep Blue Day", from the 1983 album Apollo:
            Atmospheres and Soundtracks by Lanois, Brian Eno and Roger Eno,
            saying "It mimics strings and has a little built-in bass element:
            almost one-stop instrument that provides a whole sound of an entire
            band. We found that by recording this thing and slowing it down, we
            were able to get this very beautiful, deep, jukebox sound." Lanois
            later used an Omnichord on U2's "Trip Through Your Wires" from their
            1987 album The Joshua Tree, which was also co-produced with Brian
            Eno. It was plugged it into The Edge's echo effects amplifiers to
            create the organ chords and "jangling" sound in the background.
            Lanois referred to the Omnichord as a "toy instrument" with a
            "beautiful bell-like sound". He has also used Omnichord's in his
            solo work, such as on his 1989 debut album Acadie. Eno played an
            Omnichord in a live performance of "Miss Sarajevo" with U2 and
            Luciano Pavarotti in 1995.
          </li>
          <li>Joni Mitchell played an Omnichord on "The Only Joy in Town"</li>
          <li>
            from the 1991 album Night Ride Homee David Bowie played an Omnichord
            in his live cover of Simon & Garfunkel's "America" for The Concert
            for New York City in 2001.
          </li>
          <li>
            Damon Albarn of Gorillaz used the Omnichord OM-300's "Rock 1" preset
            for the drum beat of "Clint Eastwood", which was included on the
            2001 album Gorillaz.

          <li>
            Meshell Ndegeocello's 2023 album The Omnichord Real Book became the
            first recipient of the newly created Grammy Award for Best
            Alternative Jazz Album at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards. Ndegeocello
            explains "The Omnichord gave me a way to work out melodies and ideas
            without having to look at a screen."
